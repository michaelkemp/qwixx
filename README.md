## Rules
 - Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.

- On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. 

- The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. 

- If you wish to cross out the number at the extreme right end of a color-row (red 12, yellow 12, green 2, blue 2) you must have first crossed out at least five numbers in that row. If you cross out the number on the extreme right, then also cross off the lock symbol directly next to it. This indicates that the color-row is now locked for all players and numbers of this color cannot be crossed out in future rounds. The die of the corresponding color is immediately removed from the game.

- When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.
